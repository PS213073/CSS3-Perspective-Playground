# Project Description: CSS3 Perspective Playground

This project is a simple and interactive playground designed to help users experiment with CSS3 perspective and 3D transformation properties. Built with Vue.js, it allows users to adjust the perspective, rotation along the X, Y, and Z axes of a 3D box, and instantly see the effects. Additionally, users can copy the resulting CSS transformation properties to their clipboard for use in their own projects.

## Features:
- **Real-time Adjustments**: Users can manipulate the `perspective`, `rotateX`, `rotateY`, and `rotateZ` properties using intuitive range sliders.
- **Dynamic CSS Generation**: The CSS transformation properties are dynamically updated and displayed as the sliders are adjusted.
- **Reset and Copy Functions**: A "Reset" button allows users to revert all transformations to their default states, while a "Copy" button copies the current transformation CSS to the clipboard.
- **Interactive Animations**: Clicking the "Reset" or "Copy" buttons triggers a visual click animation for enhanced user feedback.
- **Teal-Themed Design**: The interface features a modern teal color scheme, providing a visually appealing and cohesive look.

## Technologies Used:
- **Vue.js**: Handles the reactive data binding and user interactions.
- **CSS3**: Manages the 3D transformations and overall styling.
- **CSS Doodle**: Adds a dynamic background animation for visual interest.

This project serves as a practical tool for front-end developers and designers to understand and utilize CSS3 3D transformations in their web designs.
